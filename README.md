# Pixel Diagnose

Welcome to **Pixel Diagnose**! ðŸ§  Our mission is to empower radiologists with cutting-edge AI to enhance the accuracy of differential diagnoses for cancer patients. This repository contains our flagship program, **Pixel Diagnose**, designed to streamline the diagnostic process using advanced image recognition technology.

## Quick Start
Get started with our Docker image:
```bash
docker pull mkstatistics/pixel-diagnose-demo
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 mkstatistics/pixel-diagnose-demo
```

## How It Works
Pixel Diagnose is a clinician's digital assistant. It allows radiologists to upload MRI images and receive a set of differential diagnosis options. Our tool leverages various MRI modalities, such as T1, T1 with contrast, T2, and Flair, to provide comprehensive insights.

ðŸ§  Features:
- **Query Image Input**: Upload an MRI image and receive similar images from our database.
- **Segmentation Options**: Choose from whole brain or tumor-segmented images.
- **Multiple MRI Modalities**: Work with different MRI modalities for nuanced diagnosis.

## Technology
Under the hood, Pixel Diagnose uses a pretrained Resnet50 architecture for generating picture embeddings. This approach ensures high accuracy and speed in identifying similar images for a given query.

## Current Scope
Our current proof of concept supports differential diagnosis for three brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and metastasis.

## Developer Resources
In the `notebook` folder, you'll find Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate:
- Visualization techniques.
- Brain image segmentation methods.
- Steps for finetuning additional models.

## Contributing
We're a startup passionate about open-source collaboration. If you're interested in contributing to Pixel Diagnose, whether it's through code, ideas, or feedback, we'd love to hear from you!
